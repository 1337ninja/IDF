This directory contains example Trick simulations using IDF. They start by
demonstrating basic functionality and increase in complexity down the list.

1. SIM_device_only
Demonstrates reading normalized values from a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro USB
Joystick. If you only need to program against a specific device, this example
is all you need.

2. SIM_device_and_controller
Demonstrates mapping the inputs from a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick to a
generalized flight controller interface. If you want to write your control code
such that it works with many different devices, you will want to program against
a domain-specific controller rather than a particular physical device.
