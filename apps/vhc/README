Requirements:

Sun/Oracle Java SE6 (NOT OpenJDK)


Running:

build/VirtualHandController.jar is an executable JAR-file that can be run on
any OS from the command line as:

java -jar build/VirtualHandController.jar [options]

Pass -help for a list of options. Windows users can optionally double-click the
file to open it.


"build/Virtual Hand Controller.app" is a Mac application bundle that provides
users with a more native look and feel. It can be launched via double-click or
the command line as:

open build/Virtual\ Hand\ Controller.app


Compiling:

This application comes precompiled. All the other files are only useful if you
would like to make changes and recompile, in which case you will need Trick 10
and Apache Ant. Otherwise, you can delete them from your local storage. For
build options:
ant -p
