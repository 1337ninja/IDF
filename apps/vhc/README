Java Virtual Hand Controller
by Derek Bankieris


Requirements:

Java SE8


Running:

build/VirtualHandController.jar is an executable JAR-file that can be run on
any OS from the command line as:

java -jar build/VirtualHandController.jar [options]

Pass --help for a list of options. Windows users can optionally double-click the
file to open it.


build/VHC.app is a Mac application bundle that provides users with a more native
look and feel. It can be launched via double-click or the command line as:

open build/VHC.app [--args options]


Compiling:

This application comes precompiled. All the other files are only useful if you
would like to make changes and recompile, in which case you will need Trick 16
and Apache Ant. Otherwise, you can delete them from your local storage. For
build options:
ant -p
