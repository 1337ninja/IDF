Input Device Framework

Library Dependencies:

    Linux: libudev, librt

    Mac: IOKit, CoreFoundation

    Both: libntcan (only if CAN device support is required)
       Required for CAN bus device support. Avaiable for a fee at
       www.esd.eu. Follow the installation instructions to install the drivers
       and create the device nodes. Ensure you include the path to ntcan.h in
       your compiler flags and the path to libntcan.a and the option to include
       the library in your linker flags.

Permissions:

    On Linux, USB devices usually default to root-only access. To use these
    devices within IDF, you will need to add a udev rule that changes the
    permissions. See models/hidapi/udev/99-hid.rules.
